### Solutions for LeetCode problems written in the Roc programming language
Roc is a purely functional programming language that is currently under development. It is inspired by Elm, with the intention of being a fast, freindly and purely functional general purpose language.

### Purpose of this Repo
This repo contains a collection of code with solutions to various LeetCode problems, written for the purpose of hands-on learning of the Roc language. By solving these LeetCode problems, I hope to familiarize myself with Roc syntax and language features, as well as become more proficient in solving programming problems in _declarative_ instead of imperative way.
